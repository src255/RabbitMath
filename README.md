# RabbitMath
Welcome to my RabbitMath respository! I helped create animations and a game for the RabbitMath curriculum<br>
in 2020 during the summer. This respository will feature python code. I created the animations using<br>
matplotlib and the game using pygame.

## RotatingTable
This is the game code to supplement the Rotating Table problem in the Grade 12 curriculum. The goal of<br>
the game is to make the inner colour of every pad the same, i.e. make them **all** red or **all** blue.<br>
Each turn, you are allowed to reveal the colour of some of the pads (this is the variable "hands" that<br>
you choose in the python terminal) and toggle the colour of the pads between red and blue. When you are<br>
ready to continue, you can hit the spin button. The game only ends if you manage to make all of the pad<br>
colours agree.

## ShoeFling
This file creates an animation for a physics problem about flinging one's shoe while swinging on<br>
a park swing. The goal is to find the angle that maximizes the distance the shoe travels. The animations<br>
is meant to develop one's intuition for the problem before diving into the mathematics.
