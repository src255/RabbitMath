# RabbitMath
Welcome to my RabbitMath respository! I helped create animations and a game for the RabbitMath curriculum<br>
in 2020 during the summer. This respository will feature python code. I created the animations using<br>
matplotlib and the game using pygame.

## play.py
This is the game code to supplement the Rotating Table problem in the Grade 12 curriculum.<br> 
The goal of the game is to make the inner colour of every pad the same, i.e. make them **all** red or **all** blue.<br>
Each turn, you are allowed to reveal the colour of some of the pads (this is the variable "hands" that you choose<br>
in the python terminal) and toggle the colour of the pads between red and blue. When you are ready to continue,<br>
you can hit the spin button. The game only ends if you manage to make all of the pad colours agree.
